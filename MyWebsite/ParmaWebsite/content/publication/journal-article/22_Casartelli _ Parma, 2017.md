abstract = "Commentary on Keven & Akins Neonatal imitation in context: Sensorimotor development in the perinatal period Keven & Akins (K&A) propose a biologically plausible view of neonatal imitation based on the analysis of sensorimotor development. Here, we consider imitation in the general context of motor cognition, taking examples from both typical and atypical development. Specifically, we will discuss the functional role of imitation, its multilevel nature, and its anomalous features in autism."
