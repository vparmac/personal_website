I do not collect your personal information, so there is nothing about you that I can share with others.  However, Google Analytics does collect some information about you for measuring visitor traffic to this site. See the Google Analytics privacy page. This information is collected via cookies. Most web browsers allow you to control how cookies are handled so that you can disable all cookies for this website without in any way reducing its functionality.

For each visitor to reach the site, Google Analytics collects the following non-personally identifiable information: browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the site, page access times, and referring website address. I receive this information in aggregated reports for the purpose of gauging visitor traffic and trends.
