Co-supervisor: Prof. Raffaella Rumiati

*Working with Valentina is like drinking one liter of coffee per day, without its side effects. She is able to carry so much motivation and guidance to the work you are doing that, no matter what, you are going to see the end of it. And, trust me, she's good enough that you are going to hate her for how persistent she can be with you.*
