This course will provide you with basic skills and information to systematically critique claims and research in the popular press and research literature. You will be introduced to basic research concepts, such as correlation vs. causation, common biases, hypotheses, dependent/independent variables, validity, and reliability. You will apply this knowledge to evaluating a wide range of ideas and research in psychology.\nHumans fall prey of biases and fallacies that interfere with their ability to draw sound conclusions about situations. This has repercussions on academic and professional life, but also on personal life. Critical thinking is a skill that facilitates the identification of these biases and fallacies and helps us succeed in school, work and life in general. By completing this course, you will learn to identify common fallacies in thought and reasoning, learn to evaluate reliable sources of evidence, distinguish science from pseudoscience, gain a basic understanding of research strategies, research design, and analysis in psychology.

First, to provide skills to autonomously produce high-quality, technical and non-technical documents (e.g., papers, books), presentations and websites in a fast and replicable way via R and RMarkdown. R is a free, open source, powerful and highly extensible programmable environment that uses command-line scripting to create and edit specific workflows (e.g., replicate data analysis and graphs step-by-step). RMarkdown is a format for writing reproducible, dynamic reports with R. It is widely used: from college students, who want to give a professional look to their work to Airbnb, who prepares most of their reports with these methods and shares them with their business partners. Second, to learn how to find support for your digital endeavours (e.g., write a paper, create a website, speed up repeated computations, create professional-looking graphics) and keep learning to reach your goals.

Since information from different sensory modalities is integrated into a unified conceptual knowledge, we hypothesize that the social information from body odors and faces would be integrated during encoding. The integration of such social information would enhance retrieval more so than when the encoding occurs in the context of common odors. To examine this hypothesis and to further explore the underlying neural correlates of this behavior, we have conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which participants performed an encoding‐retrieval memory task for faces during the presentation of common odor, body odor or clean air. At the behavioral level, results show that participants were less biased and faster in recognizing faces when presented in concomitance with the body odor compared to the common odor. At the neural level, the encoding of faces in the body odor condition, compared to common odor and clean air conditions, showed greater activation in areas related to associative memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), odor perception and multisensory integration (orbitofrontal cortex). These results suggest that face and body odor information were integrated and as a result, participants were faster in recognizing previously presented material.","tags":["Sensory","Social"],"title":"Human body odor increases familiarity for faces during encoding‐retrieval task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javier Albayay","Umberto Castiello","_Valentina Parma_"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576627200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576627200,"objectID":"7471ac2a180cc4569bc91482f3d3917c","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/42_albayay-et-al.-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/42_albayay-et-al.-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Whether emotional stimuli influence both response readiness and inhibition is highly controversial. Visual emotional stimuli appear to interfere with both under certain conditions (e.g., task relevance). Whether the effect is generalisable to salient yet task-irrelevant stimuli, such as odours, remains elusive. We tested the effect of orthonasally-presented pleasant (orange) and unpleasant odours (trimethyloxazole and hexenol) and clean air as a control on response inhibition. In emotional Go/No-Go paradigms, we manipulated the intertrial interval and ratios of Go/No-Go trials to account for motor (Experiment 1, *N* = 31) and cognitive (Experiment 2, *N* = 29) response inhibition processes. In Experiment 1, participants had greater difficulty in withholding and produced more accurate and faster Go responses under the pleasant vs. the control condition. Faster Go responses were also evident in the unpleasant vs. the control condition. In Experiment 2, neither pleasant nor unpleasant odours modulated action withholding, but both elicited more accurate and faster Go responses as compared to the control condition. Pleasant odours significantly impair action withholding (as compared to the control condition), indicating that more inhibitory resources are required to elicit successful inhibition in the presence of positive emotional information. This modulation was revealed for the motor aspect of response inhibition (fast-paced design with lower Go/No-Go trial ratio) rather than for attentional interference processes. Response readiness is critically impacted by the emotional nature of the odour (but not by its valence). Our findings highlight that the valence of task-irrelevant odour stimuli is a factor significantly influencing response inhibition.","tags":["Action"],"title":"Task-irrelevant odours affect both response inhibition and response readiness in fast-paced Go/No-Go task: the case of valence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Javier Albayay","Patricia Villarroel-Gruner","Claudio Bascour-Sandoval","_Valentina Parma_","Germán Gálvez-García"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572825600,"objectID":"c63b353861eb1e1daa7a973d84467085","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/41_albayay-et-al.-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/41_albayay-et-al.-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"An individual’s nervous and cognitive systems are lateralized, and handedness represents a behavioral mani- festation of such organization. Therefore, accurately and reliably measuring handedness has repercussion on our understanding of both the human brain and cognition. The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) is the most frequently used instrument to measure handedness both in clinical practice and research. We assessed the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the EHI in a sample of 348 Chilean university students by confirmatory factor analysis. Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability were calculated to evaluate the internal consistency and reliability of the EHI, while the average variance extracted was estimated to evaluate its con- vergent validity. A 10-item unifactorial structure was confirmed, with factor loadings ≥0.50, showing excellent goodness-of-fit indicators, very high internal consistency and adequate composite reliability and convergent validity. Socio-demographic variables (sex, area of residence and belonging to an indigenous people or com- munity) did not significantly modulate the EHI scores. Overall, by using this validated version of the EHI to accurately and reliably measure handedness in the greater Spanish population, researchers will be able to produce robust data to tackle the still open questions of lateralization in human cognitive and neural archi- tecture.","tags":["Action"],"title":"Psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory in a sample of Chilean undergraduate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Valentina Parma_","Kevin Arceneaux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"de9de108ef452a1e9192fb7cface64ee","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/40_parma-arceneaux_2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/40_parma-arceneaux_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Sensory","Social"],"title":"Disgust Sensitivity and the Development of Political Attitudes among Children and Their Parents","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Being hungry, the food's caloric density, and the subjective valence attributed to various foods are known factors that modulate food choices. Yet, how these factors relatively and altogether contribute to the food choice process is still unknown. In this study, we showed 16 healthy young adults low- and high-calorie food when hungry or fed, and we asked them to evaluate the valence of each visually-presented food. To compute the relative influence of hunger, caloric density and valence on food choice, we applied a hierarchical drift diffusion model (HDDM). Results indicated that hunger, caloric density and valence affected how fast participants accumulated information in favor of the chosen item over the other. When fed, participants were faster in choosing low-calorie foods and foods with a higher valence. Conversely, when hungry, participants were faster in choosing highcalorie foods, including food items with lower subjective valence. All in all, these findings confirm the complex nature of food choices and the usefulness of nuanced computational models to address the multifaceted nature of decision-making and value assessment processes affecting food selection.","tags":["Miscellanea"],"title":"A Hierarchical-Drift Diffusion Model of the Roles of Hunger, Caloric Density and Valence in Food Selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cinzia Cecchetto","Elisa Lancini","Domenica Bueti","Raffaella Ida Rumiati","_Valentina Parma_"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"9d5a2f4b24067b15eb66dc3aa6e19cc0","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/37_cecchetto-et-al.-2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/37_cecchetto-et-al.-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Morality evolved within specific social contexts that are argued to shape moral choices. In turn, moral choices are hypothesized to be affected by body odors as they powerfully convey socially-relevant information. We thus investigated the neural underpinnings of the possible body odors effect on the participants’ decisions. In an fMRI study we presented to healthy individuals 64 moral dilemmas divided in incongruent (real) and congruent (fake) moral dilemmas, using different types of harm (intentional: instrumental dilemmas, or inadvertent: accidental dilemmas). Participants were required to choose deontological or utilitarian actions under the exposure to a neutral fragrance (masker) or body odors concealed by the same masker (masked body odor). Smelling the masked body odor while processing incongruent (not congruent) dilemmas activates the supramarginal gyrus, consistent with an increase in prosocial attitude. When processing accidental (not instrumental) dilemmas, smelling the masked body odor activates the angular gyrus, an area associated with the processing of people’s presence, supporting the hypothesis that body odors enhance the saliency of the social context in moral scenarios. These results suggest that masked body odors can influence moral choices by increasing the emotional experience during the decision process, and further explain how sensory unconscious biases affect human behavior.","tags":["Sensory","Social"],"title":"Body Odors (even when Masked) Make you More Emotional: Behavioral and Neural insights","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marilena Aiello*","_Valentina Parma*_","Sara De Carlo","Thomas Hummel","Raffaella I.

Here, we investigate sex differences in the perception of the Numbness Illusion (NI), a procedure based on a tactile conflict, in adults with ASD and with typical development. We aim to assess if women and men with ASD perceive NI-dependent body ownership differently and whether sex differences emerge in individuals with typical development. To elicit the NI, participants pressed their right-hand palm against the confederate's hand and stroked with the thumb and the index finger of their left hand the joined index fingers in a synchronous or asynchronous way. Results reveal that women with ASD present a reversed and atypical pattern for the NI compared to men with ASD and a group of matched controls. In particular, women with ASD report a stronger illusion than men with ASD, that is more evident in the asynchronous conditions. In the asynchronous condition, women in the ASD group report stronger NI as compared to women and men in the Control group, whereas men with ASD only to men in the Control group. In the typical sample, the NI emerges only in the synchronous condition and no sex difference is observed. We discuss our results in terms of potential advantage of women in sociality and sensory information processing that might lead women with ASD to use different modalities to solve the illusion compared to men with ASD. In sum, these outcomes describe sex differences in individuals with ASD in the domain of illusory perception. This may be used in the future to support the characterization of the female phenotype of autism.","tags":["Action","ASD","Social"],"title":"Sex Differences in Body Ownership in Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Smiljana Mutic","Jessica Freiherr","Annachiara Cavazzana","Marta Rocha","Sandra C.

With the aim to  investigate effects of female body odor in a competitive context, we tested 51 women divided into two groups (i.e., a competitive and a non-competitive group, based on verbal instructions). Between groups, we explored whether female body odor exposure (vs. masker odor) modulates emotion categorization (via RT variance and distribution) and physiological reactions (via instantaneous heart rate) in a task with dynamic male and female faces as either angry or happy. Women in the competitive group reported to feel more competitive and performed more accurately. They gathered more emotional information to categorize dynamic faces and when additionally exposed to female body odor, they showed a resistance to cardiac deceleration. Lapses of attention (via RT distribution) occurred irrespective of body odor exposure. Our results support the idea that female body odors, presented in a competitive context, contrast cardiac deceleration and, by tendency, modulate emotion categorization.

It has recently been shown that body odors can affect moral decision-making, by increasing the activations in neural areas processing social and emotional information during the decision process. The aim of the present study was twofold: 1) to test whether body odors selectively affect decisions to real dilemmatic moral scenario (incongruent) vs. fake (congruent) dilemmas, and 2) to characterize whether the impact of masked body odors is modulated by four conceptual factors: personal force, intentionality, benefit recipient and evitability. Women chose between utilitarian (sacrificing a person's life in order to save other lives) or deontological actions (deciding against the harmful action) in 64 moral dilemmas under the exposure of a neutral fragrance (masker) or a masked male body odor. Our results showed that the masked male body odor did not specifically affect the answers to real and fake dilemmas but instead, its effect is modulating whether the agent harms the victim in a direct or indirect manner (personal force) to save herself or only other people (benefit recipient). In particular, when exposed to the masked body odor participants gave more deontological answers when the harm was indirect and only other people were saved. These data support the hypothesis that body odors induce participants to perceive the individuals described in moral dilemmas as more real, triggering harm avoidance.","tags":["Sensory","Action"],"title":"Women Smelling Men's Masked Body Odors Show Enhanced Harm Aversion in Moral Dilemmas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Rocha*","_Valentina Parma*_","Johan N.

In particular, their effects are maximal when their presence is paired with meaningful social contexts. Static faces have been widely used as social stimuli. However, they miss a key feature of our phenomenological experience, characterized by multisensory dynamic stimulations. Here, we investigate how BO sampled from individuals experiencing a transitory anxiety state, (a) induce a stress response and (b) bias the recognition of dynamic facial expressions, compared with BO of relaxed individuals. Participants (n¼46) categorized the emotion of a face, morphing from a neutral expression to either an angry or happy expression, during exposure to either BO condition. In addition, their cardiac activity was measured. Exposure to anxiety BO increased the accuracy of dynamic facial recognition and reduced cardiac parasympathetic activity. These results suggest that in social situations that simulate part of the multisensory and dynamic features of real-life social contexts, anxiety BOs will induce a stress response in recipients, modulating both arousal and cognitive-emotional skills but facilitating emotional facial processing.","tags":["Sensory","Social"],"title":"Anxiety Body Odors as Context for Dynamic Faces: Categorization and Psychophysiological Biases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentin A.

The intensity of the neutral odor also increased following the exposure to both negative BOs.

However, current odor identification tests focus on children from age 6 and older and no cross-cultural test has to date been validated and fully implemented.

Results confirmed that cued odor identification performance increases with age and revealed little to no differences between girls and boys. Scores below 3 and below 6 may raise hyposmia concerns in US children aged 3–7 years and 8–10 years, respectively. Even though the completion rate of the task reached the 88%, suggesting that children below age 5 were able to finish the test, their performance was relatively poor. In comparing the overall identification performance of US children with that of German children, for whom the test was specifically developed, significant differences emerged, with higher scores obtained by the German sample. Analysis of errors indicated that a lack of semantic knowledge for the olfactory-presented objects may be at the root of poor identification skills in US children and therefore constitutes a problem in the development of an odor identification test for younger children valid across cultures.","tags":["Sensory"],"title":"A Cross-Cultural Adaptation of the Sniffin’ Sticks Olfactory Identification Test for US children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Valentina Parma_","Donald A.

Here we examined the multisensory nature of body ownership in individuals with ASD by using a procedure based on tactile conflicts, namely the numbness illusion (NI). _Method_ We induced an illusory feeling of numbness and ownership for another person's finger by asking participants to hold their palm against another person's palm and to stroke the two joined index fingers with the index and thumb of their other hand. _Results_ As expected, when the agent self-strokes their finger, healthy participants do not perceive the NI if the stroking is performed asynchronously. Conversely, in individuals with ASD the illusion occurred with both synchronous and asynchronous self-stroking. _Conclusions_ We contend that individuals with ASD are more vulnerable than controls to this illusory tactile experience and we discuss the findings in light of impaired perception of the temporal relationships between tactile and proprioceptive inputs.","tags":["Action","ASD","Social"],"title":"In Sync or not in Sync?

However, they are often hardly comparable across languages and cultures. Here, we propose a methodology to adapt, convert and test moral dilemmas in languages different from English, by outlining the process followed for the creation of the comprehensive 4CONFiDe set. _Methods_ To evaluate cultural effects, English and Italian versions of the 4CONFiDe were evaluated by English-native speakers proficient in Italian, and Italian-native speakers proficient in English (Study 1). To assess the contribution of the four conceptual factors used by Christensen et al. to the levels of arousal, valence and familiarity experienced with each dilemma, an independent group of Italian native speakers (n = 112) completed the 4CONFiDe set (Study 2). _Results_ Both linear mixed models and Bayesian statistics confirmed that moral choices were made irrespective of participants', native language and dilemmas' version, suggesting that the translation was culturally-representative. Moreover, they showed that the proposed dilemmas were perceived by participants with different degrees of arousal, pleasantness and familiarity based on some of the conceptual factors and that three of the four conceptual factors (Personal force, Intentionality and Evitability) determined participants' moral choices. _Conclusions_ Standardized, culturally-equivalent moral dilemmas provide researchers with a tool that allows further developments of the field.","tags":["Social","Miscellanea"],"title":"Promoting Cross-Culture Research on Moral Decision-Making with Standardized, Culturally-Equivalent Dilemmas The 4CONFiDe Set","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cinzia Cecchetto","Raffaella Ida Rumiati","_Valentina Parma_"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"43e0589df3296722fa7e95966c9fba24","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/21_cecchetto-et-al.-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/21_cecchetto-et-al.-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Meta-analytic evidence showed that the chemical senses affect moral decisions.

Study 1a suggests that the presence of an odour plays a role in shaping moral choice. Study 1b reveals that of two iso-pleasant versions of the same neutral odour, only the one presented sub-threshold (vs. supra-threshold) favours deontological moral choices, those based on the principle of not harming others even when such harm provides benefits. As expected, this odour intensity effect is tracked by skin conductance responses, whereas no difference in cardiac activity - proxy for the valence dimension - is revealed. Study 2 suggests that the same neutral odour presented sub-threshold increases deontological choices even when compared to isointense ambiguous odour, perceived as pleasant or unpleasant by half of the participants, respectively. Skin conductance responses, as expected, track odour pleasantness, but cardiac activity fails to do so.

We propose an approach that explains postnatal handedness starting from 18 gestational weeks using a kinematic analysis of different fetal arm movements recorded during ultrasonography. Based on the hand dominance reported postnatally at age 9, the fetuses were classified as right-handed (86%) or left-handed, in line with population data. We revealed that both right-handed and left-handed fetuses were faster to reach to targets requiring greater precision (i.e., eye and mouth), with their dominant (vs. non-dominant) hand. By using either movement times or deceleration estimates, handedness can be inferred with a classification accuracy ranging from 89 to 100% from gestational week 18. The reliability of this inference hints to the yet unexplored potential of standard ultrasonography to advance our understanding of prenatal life.","tags":["Action"],"title":"The Origin of Human Handedness and its Role in Pre-Birth Motor Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Foroni","Miriam Vignando","Marilena Aiello","_Valentina Parma_","Maurizio Guido Paoletti","Andrea Squartini","Raffaella I.

Participants' ability to discriminate two wines only based on the olfactory features of their terroir (zone and vineyard), their variety (e.g., cabernet vs. merlot) or both was tested. Olfactory discrimination performance of both novices and wine-professionals reflected whether two wines differed by terroir, variety or both. Performance peaked when wines differed in both terroir and variety, with terroir being more easily discriminated than variety. These results, obtained by controlling for the first time the precision of the olfactory stimulation, provide insightful clues in understanding the wine appreciation process, specifically with respect to the perceptual aspects of terroir.","tags":["Sensory"],"title":"The smell of terroir!

Understanding the relationship between social and non-social difficulties in ASD is a major challenge for researchers: Do these difficulties equally contribute to the condition or is one a primary cause? Are these relationships present across the autism spectrum? Do they share the same pathogenesis or do different causes drive them?\nStudying the sense of smell in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) represents a promising tool to answer these questions. Indeed, smelling is a byproduct of involuntary breathing which often occurs outside of conscious awareness, making it a tool usable across the spectrum.

Given the relative affective strength of olfaction and its relevance in mediating social information since birth, we assessed olfactory--visual matching abilities in a group of 140 children between the ages of 3 and 11 years old. We presented one of three odor primes (rose, fish and no--odor, rated as pleasant or unpleasant by individual children) before a facial choice task (happy vs. disgusted face). Children were instructed to select one of two faces. As expected, children of all ages tended to choose happy faces. Children younger than 5 years of age were biased towards choosing the happy face, i-rrespective of the odor smelled. After age 5, an affective matching strategy guided children's choices. Smelling a pleasant odor predicted the choice of happy faces, whereas smelling the unpleasant or fish odor predicted the choice of disgusted faces. The present study fills a gap in the developmental literature on olfactory--visual affective strategies that affect decision--making, and represents an important step towards understanding the underlying developmental processes that shape the typical social mind.","tags":["Sensory","Social"],"title":"When Preschoolers Follow their Eyes and Older Children Follow their Noses: Visuo-Olfactory Social Affective Matching in Childhood","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Smiljana Mutic","_Valentina Parma_","Yvonne F.

Humans communicate socially relevant information using all sensory modalities, including the chemosensory systems. In study 1, we investigated whether the body odor of a stranger with the intention to harm serves as a chemosignal of aggression. Sixteen healthy male participants donated their body odor while engaging in a boxing session characterized by aggression-induction methods (chemosignal of aggression) and while performing an ergometer session (exercise chemosignal). Self-reports on aggression-related physical activity, motivation to harm and angry emotions selectively increased after aggression induction. In study 2, we examined whether receivers smelling such chemosignals experience emotional contagion (e.g., anger) or emotional reciprocity (e.g., anxiety). The aggression and exercise chemosignals were therefore presented to 22 healthy normosmic participants in a double-blind, randomized exposure during which affective/cognitive processing was examined (i.e., emotion recognition task, emotional stroop task). Behavioral results indicate that chemosignals of aggression induce an affective/ cognitive modulation compatible with an anxiety reaction in the recipients. These findings are discussed in light of mechanisms of emotional reciprocity as a way to convey not only affective but also motivational information via chemosensory signals in humans.","tags":["Sensory","Social"],"title":"You Smell Dangerous: Communicating Fight Responses Through Human Chemosignals of Aggression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

The repeated conditioning group participated in repeated sessions over 2 weeks whereas the single conditioning group participated in 1 conditioning session; both groups were presented with visual and olfactory stimuli, were paired with an electric shock (CS+) and 2 matched control stimuli not paired with shock (CS-) while olfactory detection threshold and skin conductance responses (SCRs) were measured before and after the last session. We found increased sensitivity for the CS+ odor in the repeated but not in the single conditioning group, consistent with changes in olfactory sensitivity following repeated aversive learning and of a similar magnitude to what has previously been demonstrated in the periphery. SCR to the visual and olfactory CS+ were similar between groups, indicating that sensory thresholds can change without corresponding change in conditioned responses. In conclusion, repeated conditioning increases detection sensitivity and reduces conditioned responses, suggesting that segregated processes influence perception and conditioned responses.","tags":["Sensory"],"title":"Enhancement of Odor Sensitivity Following Repeated Odor and Visual Fear Conditioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Valentina Parma_","Maria Bulgheroni","Roberto Tirindelli","Umberto Castiello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"3ece203071a7f55401c0e00deec2b3fc","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/12_parma-et-al.-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/12_parma-et-al.-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Imitation is a key socio-cognitive skill impaired in individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). It is known that the familiarity with an actor facilitates the appearance of imitative abilities. Here, we explore whether a highly familiar and socially relevant stimulus presented in the olfactory modality is able to improve spontaneous imitation as early as at the level of action planning. A group of 20 children with ASC and 20 controls observed their own mother or the mother of another child performing a reach-to-grasp action towards an object, under the exposure to their maternal odor, the odor of the mother of another child or no odor. Subsequently, children acted upon the same object with no specific instruction to imitate. Child’s movement initiation time (MIT) served as an indicator of motor planning facilitation induced by action observation. Results suggest that for children with ASC (but not controls) MIT was significantly lower when exposed to the maternal odor both when interacting with a familiar or an unfamiliar model. In the former case, the performance is comparable to controls. The familiar model in the absence of any olfactory cue is able to induce a facilitation effect, but the maximal facilitation on MIT is evident when maternal odor and familiar model are paired. We hypothesize that for children with ASC the maternal odor provides relevant social motivation for taking advantage of others’ actions when planning movements in an imitative context.","tags":["ASD","Sensory","Social","Clinical"],"title":"Facilitation of Action Planning in Children with Autism The Contribution of the Maternal Body Odor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Valentina Parma_","Debora Zanatto","Elisa Straulino","Tomaso Scaravilli","Umberto Castiello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"821bfb4ad08e2f81fca8474372b217f4","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/11_parma-et-al.-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/11_parma-et-al.-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"The performance of patients with vascular parkinsonism (VPD) on a reach-to-grasp task was compared with that of patients affected by idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) and age-matched control subjects.

On Day 2, without prior notice, participants were requested to recognize the target amongst a set of distractors, characterized by various flavours (orange vs. tangerine) and/or sizes (orange-like vs. tangerine-like). Similarly, targets and distractors consisting of 2D figures varying in shape and size were used to assess visual memory. Reach-to-grasp kinematics towards the targets were recorded and analysed by means of digitalization techniques. Correlations between kinematic parameters, memory and liking for each food item were also calculated.

Individuals with this diagnosis are reported to often identify people by repetitively sniffing pieces of clothing or the body odor of family members. Since body odors are known to initiate and mediate many different social behaviors, smelling the body odor of a family member might constitute a sensory-based action promoting social contact. In light of this, we hypothesized that the body odor of a family member would facilitate the appearance of automatic imitation, an essential social skill known to be impaired in autism. _Methods_ We recruited 20 autistic and 20 typically developing children. Body odors were collected from the children’s mothers’ axillae. A child observed a model (their mother or a stranger mother) execute (or not) a reach-to-grasp action toward an object. Subsequently, she performed the same action. The object was imbued with the child’s mother’s odor, a stranger mother’s odor, or no odor. The actions were videotaped, and movement time was calculated post hoc via a digitalization technique. _Results_ Automatic imitation effects—expressed in terms of total movement time reduction—appear in autistic children only when exposed to objects paired with their own mother’s odor. _Conclusions_ The maternal odor, which conveys a social message otherwise neglected, helps autistic children to covertly imitate the actions of others. Our results represent a starting point holding theoretical and practical relevance for the development of new strategies to enhance communication and social behavior among autistic individuals.","tags":["Action","Clinical","Sensory","Social"],"title":"Body Odors Promote Automatic Imitation in Autism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Valentina Parma_","Maria Bulgheroni","Tomaso Scaravilli","Roberto Tirindelli","Umberto Castiello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b48243a80de384db487e141ed046a000","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/7_parma-et-al.-2013/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/7_parma-et-al.-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Many reports in the literature indicate that idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients have substantial olfactory dysfunctions even before motor symptoms become evident. It has not yet been clarified, however, if some form of implicit olfactory processing is preserved in this population. An olfactory visuomotor priming paradigm, which detects implicit olfactory processing in neurologically healthy participants, was utilized to investigate motor control in relation to olfactory signals in a group of IPD patients. Two control groups were also considered 12 vascular Parkinson's disease (VPD) in whom normal olfactory abilities are typically reported and 12 neurologically healthy participants. All of the participants were asked to perform reach-to-grasp movements toward large or small targets following olfactory cues delivered by a computer-controlled olfactometer. The odor was either 'size' congruent with the target (e.g., strawberry or apple, respectively) or incongruent (e.g., apple or strawberry, respectively). A bend sensor glove (CyberGlove) was used to measure the hand kinematics. Facilitation effects were noted in all the groups with regard to movement time. If a congruent rather than an incongruent odor was delivered, the movement time of the reach-to-grasp was shortened and facilitation effects in maximum grip amplitude were noted in both the IPD and the VPD groups. The maximum grip amplitude was smaller when no odor, as compared to a congruent odor, was delivered. The present results suggest that implicit olfactory processing affects motor control in IPD patients favoring less severe bradykinesia and hand movement hypometria. Once confirmed, these findings could be useful when rehabilitation strategies are being hypothesized for these patients.","tags":["Action","Clinical","Sensory"],"title":"Implicit Olfactory Processing Attenuates Motor Disturbances in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Valentina Parma_","Debora Zanatto","Umberto Castiello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"9bdddf287e3ffa619b308bc2bc62b67a","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/9_parma-et-al.-2013/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/9_parma-et-al.-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Observing the actions of others prompts the motor system to perform a similar action.

It has been hypothesized that the human sex-steroid derived compound 4,16-androstadien-3-one (androstadienone) functions as a human chemosignal. The most intensively studied steroid compound, androstadienone is known to be biologically relevant since it seems to convey information about male mate quality to women. It is unclear if the effects of androstadienone are menstrual cycle related. _Methodology/Principal Findings_ In the first experiment, heterosexual women were exposed to androstadienone or a control compound and asked to view stimuli such as female faces, male faces and familiar objects while their eye movements were recorded. In the second experiment the same women were asked to rate the level of stimuli attractiveness following exposure to the study or control compound. The results indicated that women at high conception risk spent more time viewing the female than the male faces regardless of the compound administered. Women at a low conception risk exhibited a preference for female faces only following exposure to androstadienone. _Conclusions/Significance_ We contend that a woman's level of fertility influences her evaluation of potential competitors (e.g., faces of other women) during times critical for reproduction. Subliminally perceived odorants, such as androstadienone, might similarly enhance intrasexual competition strategies in women during fertility phases not critical for conception. These findings offer a substantial contribution to the current debate about the effects that subliminally perceived body odors might have on behavior.","tags":["Action","Sensory","Social"],"title":"Subliminally Perceived Odours Modulate Female Intrasexual Competition An Eye Movement Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["_Valentina Parma_","Roberto Roverato","Deborah Ghirardello","Maria Bulgheroni","Roberto Tirindelli","Umberto Castiello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"0cfb55f5434510a1a0e1c700a7e99500","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/4_parma-et-al.-2011/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/4_parma-et-al.-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Research on multisensory integration during natural tasks has revealed how chemical senses contribute to plan and control movements.

Results show that hand and lip apertures were scaled according to the size of the object evoked by the flavor. Maximum hand and lip apertures were greater when the action toward a small visual target (e.g., strawberry) was preceded by a sip of a ‘‘large’’ (e.g., orange) than a ‘‘small’’ (e.g., almond) flavor solution. Conversely, maximum hand and lip apertures were smaller when the action toward a large visual target (e.g., apple) was preceded by the presentation of a ‘‘small’’ (e.g., strawberry) rather than a ‘‘large’’ flavor solution.

The ASD+Anxiety and Anxiety Alone groups showed different sympathetic, but similar parasympathetic, activity. Correlational, multivariate, and regression analyses indicated that the four groups differed among several physiological and subjective measures. _Conclusion_ These findings suggest that ASD and anxiety are associated with distinct profiles of autonomic nervous system activity that cannot be reduced to either the sympathetic or parasympathetic branch alone.
