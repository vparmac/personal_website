Valentina Parma is Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Temple University, Philadelphia (PA). 

Her research is focused at understanding how **social behavior** across development is influenced by subtle cues - such as **smells**. By studying the ways in which odors bias people's physiology and behavior across typical and atypical development, her research offers insights into how humans direct and control communication, emotion regulation, actions and contact with outgroups. 

She is also focuses her research on deviations from typical social behaviors since the sense of smell is an unexplored tool to promote the development of strategies to detect and treat atypical social behaviors, as she has been uncovering in the realm of **autism spectrum disorder**.

When she is not busy making her favorite dessert (for those who are curious, it's *croquembouche*), she is invested in supporting and advising peers and students and she advocates for women scientists particularly through her work with [**Women In Olfactory Science**](https://www.facebook.com/WomenInOlfactoryScience/).
