I am Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Temple University, Philadelphia (PA). My research's goal is to understand how **social behavior** is influenced by unconscious cues - such as **smells**. By studying the ways in which odors bias people's physiology and behavior across typical and atypical development, my research offers insights into how humans communicate, direct and control emotions, cognition, actions and contact with outgroups. 

I investigare the sense of smell as an unexplored tool to promote the development of strategies to detect and treat atypical social behaviors, such as those I have been uncovering in the realm of **autism spectrum disorder**.

When I am not busy making my favorite dessert (for those who are curious, it's *croquembouche*), I consult for [**CyNexo**](http://www.cynexo.com/) on the development of odor-delivery methods, and I am invested in supporting and advising peers and students. I advocate for women scientists particularly through my work with [**Women In Olfactory Science**](https://www.facebook.com/WomenInOlfactoryScience/).
