Sociality has a crucial adaptive value.
Starting from perceptual illusions (see my work on the [**numbness illusion**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/34_guerra-et-al.-2019/)) and multisensory integration (see my work on the [**visuo-olfactory affective matching**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/17_cavazzana-et-al.-2016/) to  analyzing the olfactory impact of [**female intra-sexual competition**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/39_mutic-et-al.-2019/), spanning from [**moral decisions**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/21_cecchetto-et-al.-2017/) to the development of political attitudes [**political attitudes**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/40_parma-arceneaux_2019/) my work has focused on understanding how social information is processed and how dyadic behavior is regulated based on sensory, cognitive, affective and motor information. 

Behavioral, perceptual, psychophysiological, neurophysiological techniques are the tools used to uncover the functions and mechanisms of human social function.
