Classical wisdom has been telling us that the human nose is hopeless. We are disconnected from our noses, and vision is so much more (consciously) powerful in many everyday situations. But recent research demonstrates that classical wisdom should take a step back and reconsider. Our noses are subtle enough to distinguish the area in which a wine has been produced (see [**my work on the smell of terroir**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/20_foroni-et-al.-2017/), to learn over time to become more "sensitive" (see [**my work enhanced odor sensitivity following fear conditioning**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/14_parma-et-al.-2015/), to unconsciously promote targeted  scanning of the visual field (see [**my work on eye movements**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/5_parma-et-al.-2012/)), 

And they are proficient enough to promote positive health-outcomes (as we comment on [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/13_cellini-_-parma-2015/) and reveal in Parkinson's patients [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/7_parma-et-al.-2013/)) and guide everyday actions (as we repeatedly demonstate [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/9_parma-et-al.-2013/) and [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/4_parma-et-al.-2011/)).

Still, some work needs to be done to standardize and compare odor tests (see [**my work on the development of smell tests for children**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/28_schriever-et-al.-2018/) and [**cross-culture assessment**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/19_cavazzana-et-al.-2017/)) to increase a wide-spread evaluation of the sense of smell.
