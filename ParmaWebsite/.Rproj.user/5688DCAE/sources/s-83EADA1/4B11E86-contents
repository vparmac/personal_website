An accumulating body of evidence shows that humans - as many other animal species - use smells from conspecifics to transfer socially-relevant information such as *familiarity* (see [**my work on the maternal odor**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/12_parma-et-al.-2014/), *ethnicity* (see [**my work on ethnic odor signatures**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/38_parma-et-al.-2019/), *emotional states* (see [**my work on disgust and fear body odors**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/29_ferreira-et-al.-2018/), *attitudes* (see [**my work on aggression**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/15_mutic-et-al.-2015/). 

And the effects of this type of chemosignal communication can have high stakes, both in terms of *decisions* (see [**my work on how body odors shape moral choices**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/37_cecchetto-et-al.-2019/) and in terms of *behaviors* (see [**my work on how the odor of anxiety affects dental professionals**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/30_singh-et-al.-2018/). 

A better understanding of how human body odors influence social cognition and behaviour can help unravel the behavioral, psycho-physiological and neural processes underlying the human *social function*.
