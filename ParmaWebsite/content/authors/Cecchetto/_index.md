PhD Student

*I have started working with Valentina in 2014 as a PhD student and the collaboration was so successful that we are still working together on some projects. I highly recommend Valentina as supervisor: she is a very motivating and patient teacher that is able to transmit her love and enthusiasm for science. Among other things, I think that from Valentina I especially learned how to properly design a project with its aims and hypotheses, how to present and write down the story of a scientific study and how to organize my work in terms of deadlines.*
