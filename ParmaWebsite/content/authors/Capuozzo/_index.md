*Working with her has been a big inspiration. She is like a vulcano, always ready to use all her entusiasm. She has taught me not only how to conduct a research project, but also the importance of this job. She has always encouraged me to do my best, stimulating me to learn further. She was always available for problems, following me step by step. It was a pleasure to meet her and especially to work with a person so prepared, professional and nice. I have seen in her an important model to follow and I hope to collaborate again with her in the future. I am using the abilities learnt in the lab to collaborate with engineering department on work-related stress in Industry 4.0.*
