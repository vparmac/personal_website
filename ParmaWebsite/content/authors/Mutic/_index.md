*During my doctoral research, Valentina supervised me in an innovative body odor communication study. Besides the many methodological and professional aspects I got to know through her, I also learnt the importance of grit and the energetic willingness to tackle obstacles. After a long and tough streak, we recently published our work and turned it into a success story.*
