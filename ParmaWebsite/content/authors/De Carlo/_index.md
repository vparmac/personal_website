PhD Student

*I met Valentina when I started my post-graduate internship at the International School for Advanced Studies (Trieste, Italy) in 2016. She was my supervisor as well as my mentor for two years. She showed me how to have a reliable and accurate approach to research, helping me to develop my skills and to believe in myself. Her support and example remains with me, even after those two years of close collaboration.*
