Welcome to my personal website. I am Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Temple University, Philadelphia (PA) and the chair of the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research or [**GCCR**](https://gcchemosensr.org/).

In normal times, I study the ways in which unconscious cues, such as **odors**, influence typical and atypical **social and motor behavior** using behavioral and physiological methods across development.

Recently the COVID-19 pandemic has added a new dimension to my research in clinical olfaction. It has been an honor to work alongside hundreds of scientists, clinicians, and patient advocates in **GCCR** to understand how smell, taste and chemesthesis (spicy/cooling sensations) are affected by COVID-19.

I am also invested in supporting and advising peers and students, advocating for women scientists, particularly through my work with [**Women In Olfactory Science**](https://www.facebook.com/WomenInOlfactoryScience/) and consulting for [**CyNexo**](http://www.cynexo.com/) on the development of odor-delivery methods. 

I love to put my chemical senses skills at play in the kitchen, especially in the p√¢tisserie domain. Hit me up if you want my recipe for a charming *croquembouche* or a homey and radical *abbracci* (hugs).
