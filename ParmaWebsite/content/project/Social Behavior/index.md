Sociality has a crucial adaptive value. My research uses behavioral, perceptual, psychophysiological, neurophysiological techniques as tools to uncover the functions and mechanisms of human social function. 

Starting from perceptual illusions (see my work on the [**numbness illusion**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/34_guerra-et-al.-2019/)) and multisensory integration (see my work on the [**visuo-olfactory affective matching**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/17_cavazzana-et-al.-2016/)) to  analyzing the olfactory impact of [**female intra-sexual competition**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/39_mutic-et-al.-2019/), spanning from [**moral decisions**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/21_cecchetto-et-al.-2017/) to the development of political attitudes [**political attitudes**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/40_parma-arceneaux_2019/) my work focuses on understanding how we process social information and regulate dyadic behavior through sensory, cognitive, affective and motor information.
