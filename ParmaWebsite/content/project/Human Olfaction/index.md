Conventional wisdom tells us that the human nose is hopeless. We are psychologically disconnected from our noses, whereas vision is so much more (consciously) powerful in many everyday situations. However, recent research demonstrates that we should take a step back and reconsider this conventional wisdom. Our noses are subtle enough to distinguish the area in which a wine has been produced (see [**my work on the smell of terroir**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/20_foroni-et-al.-2017/)). It is capable of learning to become more "sensitive" over time (see [**my work enhanced odor sensitivity following fear conditioning**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/14_parma-et-al.-2015/)). Our noses can even unconsciously trigger targeted scanning of the visual field (see [**my work on eye movements**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/5_parma-et-al.-2012/)).

The nose is proficient enough to promote positive health-outcomes (as we comment on [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/13_cellini-_-parma-2015/) and demonstrate in [**Parkinson's patients**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/7_parma-et-al.-2013/)), and guide everyday actions (as we reveal [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/9_parma-et-al.-2013/) and [**here**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/4_parma-et-al.-2011/)).

Still, more work needs to be aimed at standardizing and comparing odor tests (see [**my work on the development of smell tests for children**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/28_schriever-et-al.-2018/)) as well as providing a [**cross-culture assessment**](http://127.0.0.1:4321/publication/journal-article/19_cavazzana-et-al.-2017/) to promote large-scale assessment of the sense of smell.
