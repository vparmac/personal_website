**Course description and goals:**

Digital applications are increasingly impacting the way we work and mastering them will help to successfully grow your career in the modern workforce. This course has two main goals. First, to provide skills to autonomously produce high-quality, technical and non-technical documents (e.g., papers, books), presentations and websites in a fast and replicable way via R and RMarkdown. R is a free, open source, powerful and highly extensible programmable environment that uses command-line scripting to create and edit specific workflows (e.g., replicate data analysis and graphs step-by-step). RMarkdown is a format for writing reproducible, dynamic reports with R. It is widely used: from college students, who want to give a professional look to their work to Airbnb, who prepares most of their reports with these methods and shares them with their business partners. Second, to learn how to find support for your digital endeavours (e.g., write a paper, create a website, speed up repeated computations, create professional-looking graphics) and keep learning to reach your goals. Class activities include discussions, hands-on experiences with R and resources at Temple, and a Presentation project.
